== Abstract

image::game_screen.png[game_screen,200,200]

_This is a project that contains 4 x 4 blocks puzzle. User can easily upload their picture to the application._

_We used Visual Studio environment with C#. First step was opening image from computer. Then we cut image to sixteen piece for adding to buttons as image._

== Introduction

Puzzle is one of the most entertaining games of our childhood. There was multiple project like this one. We wanted to re-create our childhood game with our pictures.

== Information

We used Visual Studio environment with C# language. There is one page for program startup. Then other one is for buttons. We created buttons with Windows Forms and all codes are under the button functions.

We didn't created exe yet. But all developers can easily create it. 

== Requirements

*Puzzle*
 works on Windows and requires one of the following implementations of 

* Visual Studio 
* C# Packages

[CAUTION]
====
After the instaliation you can detect some bugs on the project. That project is the first version.

== How to use

When you run the program a screen appears which tells you your highest score. If it is your first time it says `Your highest score is = -1`. After that screen you are going to see another screen. Thats the screen you need to open your picture with clicking the `Open` button. This application doesn't contains any sample picture on it.

It mixes the parts automaticly. 

On the right corner you can see your current score. You can click `Mixer` button to raise your starting point. A rigth part equals to 6.25p. So you can easily know how many parts are correct.
